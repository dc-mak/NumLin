The main point we want to make is that using linear types for BLAS
is an ``obvious'' idea, but is surprisingly under-explored. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Rust
\item ATS
\item Single-assignment C 
\item Linear Haskell
\item Bernardy and Sveningsson
\item L3
\item Boyland fractional permissions
\end{itemize}
