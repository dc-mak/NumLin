\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
\subsection{Implementation Strategy}

% TODO desugaring

Talk about how you implemented \lang\ and the general
architecture. Talk about how simple everything is, and also
about how implementing inference for fractions is. 

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

Here, evaluate the performance of the examples from the second
section.  Compare with your C implementations, and perhaps as well as
the straightforward math transcribed into (Matlab/R/Numpy?).
